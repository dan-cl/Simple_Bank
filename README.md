# Simple Bank

Simple Bank was created by Dan Clissold. It's a simple application that creates a bank account to track your current balance. It has a limited overdraft to keep your finances in-check. And to make sure your money safe, it includes some basic security.

### How was it built?

Simple Bank was built as a client side app using Javascript & Jquery, it was developed on Chrome version 57. Throughout its development the principles of TDD and OOD were front and center. Javascript's Module Pattern was used to create discrete objects with encapsulated behaviour and state, complex systems were abstracted to small manageable components with single responsibilities. The encapsulation of behaviour did however limit the extent to which the code could be tested.

### How does it work?

Firstly, this app is accessing the Jquery library through a CDN, so make sure you have internet access! It’s also worth mentioning that development was done using Chrome version 57, so to ensure you’re getting the experience the developer intended, it’s advisable to use this browser. Other than that, Jasmine is included in the Zip file, so it should be ready to go - open ‘SpecRunner.html’ to see the tests. Once you’re ready to try it out, open ‘index.html’ and follow the instructions.
